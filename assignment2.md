## Story Research
Several articles have been done regarding community access to mental health services and homelessness rates. However, I struggled to find articles that tackled both of these issues and/or were focused on DC. I really like the [Oregon](https://www.opb.org/article/2023/10/09/oregon-homelessness-history-background-housing-solutions/) article because it gives a timeline of the issue and offers possibilities for improvement. One thing I would like to do is track the development of [DC's homeless](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/05/05/dc-homeless-annual-count/) population, as the rate has just increased after a seemingly steady decline. In my project, I want to look at this rate side by side with access to mental health and addiction resources. These articles from [Chicago](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/2/11/23594689/mental-health-services-chicago-77-community-areas-211-line-editorial) and [Tennessee children](https://www.wkrn.com/special-reports/back-to-school/tennessee-ranks-near-the-bottom-when-it-comes-to-childrens-access-to-mental-healthcare/) do a good job presenting the issues and including data throughout. I have found datasets for DC that have information on homelessness, resources and income levels, but they are not combined. I think much of my work on this would come from compiling and then parsing through the different data sets below. Ideally, I'd like to sort things by ward.

### Datasets
[2018 data](https://app.box.com/s/yspij8v81cxqyebl7gj3uifjumb7ufsw) This is a huge dataset compiled by the DC Health Department. This source is from 2018 and references trends from 2011-2015. I plan on reaching out to the department to see if they have continued this or can direct me to a similar dataset, because I couldn't find any more recent editions.  
[Disparity data](https://www.dchealthmatters.org/indicators/index/dashboard?alias=disparities) I believe this will be my most helpful dataset because it is giant and includes poverty and race in its categories. This data set is trustworthy; it is compiled from hospitals in DC. The only issue I forsee is that not all of the data sets are from the same range of years. 
[Recovery data](https://myrecoverydc.org/services-by-ward/) This data set includes housing, treatment centers and other recovery aids for those suffering from addiction in DC. This data is trustworthy as it is a list of resources put together by multiple DC agencies, including the DC Department of Behavioral Health and Live Long DC, an opioid addiction service. 
[Homelessness data](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/coc/coc-homeless-populations-and-subpopulations-reports/?filter_Year=&filter_Scope=CoC&filter_State=DC&filter_CoC=DC-500&program=CoC&group=PopSub) This data is supplied by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, but it was compiled from independent reports by homeless assistance programs. I think that this data source is trustworthy but should be verified with additional data or compared over the years. As the site mentions, methodologies may have changed and HUD has not done a full search into the data's accuracy.
