## Clarity and Accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.
  * What was it?
  * Was it in the headline?
* If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent
  * Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization?
