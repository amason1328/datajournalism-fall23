The article I based my visualization off is [this one](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/02/business/air-traffic-controllers-safety.html) from the New York Times. They focus more on the staffing issues with air traffic controllers, while I decided to look at the incidents themselves. I looked at the top five airports based on the number of departures and arrivals. Based on [this report](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/by_the_numbers/media/Air_Traffic_by_the_Numbers_2023.pdf) , they are ORD, ATL, DFW, DEN and LAS. I then used [this database](https://akama.arc.nasa.gov/ASRSDBOnline/QueryWizard_Filter.aspx) that is linked in the article to find the full list of incident reports at these five airports between January 2022 and December 2023. None have been recorded yet from November-December 2023. Of 137 incidents, 100 had reported elements of human error. I decided not to filter them by airport because that would mean I would need to figure out their proportion in comparison to total flights and the data for this year isnâ€™t out yet. Instead I chose to filter by type of human error for my chart. The data and my steps on it are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U2iV7lOaGamopORRkrsUNOdXROJHwBGZ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101009817845573772292&rtpof=true&sd=true). The first page has already been filtered to include only the incidents with human factors listed.
