# Data Reporting Critique: 

[Article: How Scientology doubled its downtown Clearwater footprint in 3 years](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/scientology-clearwater-real-estate/)

## Clarity and Accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? 5
  * What was it? Scientology has doubled the amount of property it has in Clearwater, Florida in three years, threatening business owners and the city's economic strength. 
  * Was it in the headline? Yes.
* If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? 4
  * Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization? I felt that the first data visualization (the large Google map) was probably the best way they could have executed and shown the extent of the growth in Scientology properties.
  * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? The scrolling is a bit jumpy and the zoom is a bit off, especially in the later maps. I think this could likely be smoothed out a bit on the back end. 
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 4
  * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data. One thing that frustrated me about the data was that it lacked specific years. They start by saying this land grew slowly over decades and then over three years had this huge increase, but they do not tell the reader what years they are talking about. They eventually say this increase started in January 2017, but that comes much later in the article and is not explicitly linked to this prior statement. They also state that many of the buildings were purchased with limited liability companies, meaning that they have to disclose their operators but not their owners. The article later has a quote from a Scientologist where he states that his business endeavors are his own, not Scientology. The author fights this with examples of Scientology's reputation for blackmail, but I think this could have been better by asking Scientologist business owners about why or what these properties are being used for outside of the church.
  * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. I think the reporter should have been more straightforward about who it was that they actually interviewed for this. I also think they should have given more time to explaining limited liability companies because it is unclear how much the author actually tried to discover the information behind these. The article also mentions several attempts to talk to Scientology's leader through their spokespeople, which would have, in my opinion, significantly strengthened the article. I wonder if they could have asked to talk to more local leaders or found parishioners to interview. Later, they include 2017 responses from Scientology's leader but no direct quotes.
  * Did they provide a source? The data was explained as coming from over 1,000 property deeds and 90 interviews. It mentions that city officials were unaware of the full extent, but doesn't say who they talked to. Probably one of the most interesting facts presented is that properties were bought in cash, many of which weren't even on the market, for much more than their worth. I wish they had been more clear about where this info came from or provided quotes. One source they use is Mat Pesch, a former Scientologist. I think they should have used more of his input, as well as searched for another defector who could corroborate his claims. Also listed are internal church documents which the authors say include attempts to get inside the DOJ and foreign governments, but no quotes or photos of the documents are included. 
  * Did they explain everything that needed explaining? No, but I think for the amount of info the article is tackling, it does a pretty good job telling the overall story. 

## Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? 4
  * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. I felt like this story was well done. It's clearly a combination of several past research efforts, so it feels a bit jumpy at times. However, I think it does a good job explaining how the city is being impacted without getting two in the weeds or failing to provide support. I think it could be improved by spending less time on the amount of buildings, which is easily shown as vast, and more on the way this is impacting the city's economy.

## Type and Color

* The graphic in this article is a Google Map that is darkened and illuminates specific buildings as you scroll through the story. Later, more simple overhead maps are used to show the differences from 2016 to 2019, with yellow showing properties of the church and red representing those owned by parishioners and thin blue stripes representing the local government. Near the end of the article, four circles with Google maps are used to show specific properties, but they are a bit glitchy and difficult to get to show the highlighted buildings.
  * For example, did it:
    * Look like it all belonged together? Yes. I felt like this was fairly cohesive because the building that was being highlighted on the map was also highlighted in the text, making it easy to draw the connection. It was a bit annoying sometimes because you have to keep scrolling and scrolling to uncover all the buildings and move to the next step, but I also found that to be effective in showing the scale of Scientology's hold on the area.
    * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information? Yes, though it takes a bit of time to scroll through.
    * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue? The red and yellow used were easy to see but didn't seem to have any real significance. The blue stripes used to represent what is owned by the local government are very difficult to see, to the point that I could not tell them apart from the greyed out buildings that were not one of the three groups being discussed.
   
* Type 3.5
  * A map was definitely the best way to show the extent of the properties, but by the end of the article it felt overdone. I think it would have been valuable to show perhaps the amount paid for properties vs. their value or to have a line chart showing spikes in Scientologist vs. non-Scientologist purchases.

* Color 3
  * The colors were typically associated with the highlighted text, for the majority of the article this was white. The maps showing change over time that included red, yellow and the blue stripes seemed like arbitrary selections that weren't super easy to read.

## Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you? Yes, most of the time. I felt that most of this was very well done and showed what people might be wondering about. However, I found the four smaller maps highlighting specific properties to be basically useless. It seems like a pretty big loss to have not included any graphics depicting spending.
  * How?
  * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5. 3.5
